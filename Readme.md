# Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diseases based on input symptoms. The model uses three different classifiers: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The final prediction is made by taking the mode of the predictions from these classifiers.
